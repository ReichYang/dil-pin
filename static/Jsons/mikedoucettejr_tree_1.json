Planting: </strong>Find a sunny place in your yard (6 to 8 hours of sunlight daily) with well-drained soil. Dig a hole twice as wide as the root ball. Place the root ball in the hole, backfill the soil, and water to settle the roots. Adding mulch to the base of the tree with help with water retention, though it is not necessary.</p> <p><strong>2. Watering: </strong>Keep your tree well-watered in its first 3 years. If you get less than 1 inch of rain per week, water your tree.

The subject is an old juniper tree located in the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in Colorado. The park called it Everyones Favorite Tree. While on location, the artist painted to a continuous stream of comments by visitors saying what a beautiful, incredible tree this juniper is.

Description River Birch Tree was once called \"the most beautiful of trees\" by Prince Maximilian of Austria on a visit to the United States Also known as the red birch, black birch or water birch, these trees are native to the Southeastern United States. Their leaves are diamond shaped and double-toothed, and their leaves turn tallow in the fall. Early on, these trees have silvery gray bark that changes to pink, reddish-brown or black when the plant matures. Flowers bloom in the spring and winter, and small brown cones appear in the summer. River birches can grow several trunks. River Birch Tree is most notably an ornamental tree \u00a0 Its durability makes it easy for this tree to be used to create a variety of things, such as flatware, artificial limbs, and toys. River birch trees are also a source of food for wildlife such as birds and rodents (who eat its seeds). Deer eat this tree\u2019s twigs, and foliage and hummingbirds drink its sap. River birch trees tend to grow in wet environments, hence the name. They\u2019re usually found along river and stream banks, meaning they need very moist soil. Though they can tolerate drier soil, they do better when the soil is moist. Most people who have water on their properties surround it with river birch trees. \u00a0 River Birch Tree was popular among Native Americans for medical uses \u00a0 These trees are also suitable for producing shade. River birch trees can be planted as saplings or grown directly from the seed. The trees are known for their papery and peeling bark. These trees don\u2019t require much care once planted. Birch trees can also produce a fruit called \u201csamara,\u201d which can produce about 1 million seeds per year. Native Americans used river birch medicinally to treat dysentery and colds.

Shipping Dates Ships November through April Description Black Oak Tree - Quercus velutina\u00a0\u00a0For Sale Affordable, Grower Direct Prices Tennessee Wholesale Nursery Black Oak Tree deriving its name from the dark, deeply grooved nearly black bark of older trees, younger Black Oak trees may appear gray in color. They are distinguishable from its relative the red oak by deep green leaves with seven to nine pointed lobes rather than the rounded lobes of the red oak. A medium to large tree, the black oak can attain heights of 80 feet, although soil conditions will affect the tree's development. In the wild, it begins to produce acorns at about 20 years with a life span of 100 to 500 years. The Black Oak is found throughout the eastern United States north of Florida. Its exceptionally deep tap root gives it the ability to withstand drought and poor soil better than some other varieties, but it does not tolerate shade well and is difficult to transplant. Its primary use is as a shade tree grown in place. Fall foliage ranges from dull red to orange-brown, and the Black Oak can tolerate cold winters down to USDA Zone 3. Buy Fast Growing Black Oaks\u00a0 This tree grows best in moist soils. The Black Oak starts creating acorns at age two. This tree can be three feet per year. This tree is fantastic and produces large leaves that help provide lots of shade during the spring and summer. They can grow to become seventy to eighty feet tall when fully mature and look amazing. During the autumn the foliage changes to a golden in color and provide lots of bright colors. They grow best because they can adapt well to all different types of soil conditions. They bloom during the spring and early part of summer. They produce huge canopies, so they need lots of room to grow and mature into healthy and beautiful trees. This tree is terrific at the wildlife that it brings in. The squirrels love playing in the long branches of this tree and also like to dine on the acorns that it produces. It is also great to attract a wide variety of birds to an area. These trees are robust and can withstand lots of harsh weather conditions.

Planting:</strong> Plant your Weeping Willow in full sun to partial shade (any area with about 4 to 8 hours of sunlight per day), select a site with well-drained soil, and space at least 35 feet from your septic system or leach field. When you're ready to plant, dig a hole three times the width and just as deep as the root ball on your tree. Place your tree in the hole, straighten it, gently back fill the soil and tamp it down. After this process is complete, give your tree a long drink of water until the soil becomes moist.</p> <p>Spreading a layer of mulch that\u2019s about three inches thick around the base of your tree will help the soil retain moisture and prevent weeds from growing.</p> <p><strong>2. Watering:</strong> You should regularly water your Weeping Willow for the first year to keep soil evenly moist (about once or twice weekly). Water your Willow only during dry periods in successive years. Although Weeping Willows prefer moist soil, they adapt easily to drier soil.</p> <p><strong>3. Fertilizing:</strong> Choose a brand that has equal parts of each chemical component, such as 10-10-10 or 20-20-20, or a similar product, for optimum results. Applying fertilizer that contains nitrogen produces greener, lusher plants, and accelerates growth. Fertilize in early spring, before new growth begins.</p> <p><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>4. Pruning:</strong> Thinning the crown increases air circulation, which pushes wind through the tree and helps prevent disease. A good rule of thumb is to prune 2 inches between branches at the top of the tree during early spring, before new growth emerges.</p> <p>Also, trim back any branches dragging the ground. And pinch or clip off nubs that grow from the trunk to maintain the classic Weeping shape. Broken branches, dead branches, or diseased wood can be removed year-round.</p>", "type_name": "product", "id": "e7b757892fdc76502b86e2f84ed57809", "actions": [], "apple_touch_icon_link":

The Meyer Lemon is the ideal tree to grow in a pot and overwinter indoors. It will only grow 6 \u2013 8 feet tall and will thrive for many years in a pot. The fruit is deeper in color, juicer and a little sweeter than common lemons, making it ideal for homemade lemonade, lemon desserts and homemade sorbets. Your tree will flower and fruit even when young and has scented white flowers in spring and the round, deep yellow lemons are ripe from November to March.  \tPerfect size for long-term pot growing  \tTop quality fruit with unique flavor and full of juice  \tKeep indoors in winter, outdoors in summer  \tGreat tree for a glassed-in porch or sun-room  \tEasily grown and problem-free If you are fortunate to live in a warm area, this tree will of course also grow well outdoors, but the good news is that for almost everyone, the Meyer Lemon brings the ability to grow your own citrus into every home, no matter where you live.

Planting: </strong>Though it's tolerant of soggy soils, October Glory prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure (at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily). When you're ready to plant, dig a hole three times the width of the root ball and as deep. Plant the root ball in the hole and backfill with enriched, loose soil. Water thoroughly after the root ball has been established and place a layer of thick protective mulching over the topsoil to control for weeds, pests, and suckers.</p> <p><strong>2. Watering: </strong>The October Glory Maple will appreciate a minimum of one and a half inches of water per week, whether from rainfall or irrigation. This translates to about one thorough watering from the garden hose each week (water for about 30 seconds to 1 minute).</p> <p><strong>3. Fertilizing: </strong>Use a slow-release fertilizer in a 10-10-10 formula twice per month during the growing season. Cease fertilizing when the tree is nearing its dormancy stage.</p>", "type_name": "product", "id": "b00672de930f59809443f5f7c11822c2", "actions": [], "apple_touch_icon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/d7ef078ae91d94931c0f499a118cf511d8cce83d38508162c422cdeb.png?7cbf8dcce24b7ae67280952669007b1a", "type": "richpingriddata"}, "has_required_attribution_provider": false, "reaction_counts": {}, "access": [], "id": "847591592358034475", "embed": null, "promoted_is_removable": false, "is_prefetch_enabled": false, "title": "", "is_downstream_promotion": false, "promoter": null, "story_pin_data_id": null, "board": {"url": "/oldranchconstru/ranch-house/", "name": "Ranch House"}, "videos": null, "did_its": [], "grid_title": "October Glory Red Maple Tree", "carousel_data": null, "debug_info_html": null, "aggregated_pin_data": {}, "image_signature": "ac43dd186877815ca7af3c21cf2bac82", "domain": "fast-growing-trees.com", "description": " ", "link": "https://www.fast-growing-trees.com/products/octoberglory?gclid=Cj0KCQjwyoHlBRCNARIsAFjKJ6ABkwQEltwjsKmm2S9_5oIBk4nk4s07cy_u2MhlRHjJwI6uMLeZHKcaAiCJEALw_wcB", "shopping_flags": [8, 1, 11, 6], "image_crop": {"min_y": 0, "max_y": 1}, "created_at": "Sun, 23 Feb 2020 18:42:43 +0000", "images": {"170x": {"width": 170, "height": 179, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/170x/ac/43/dd/ac43dd186877815ca7af3c21cf2bac82.jpg"}, "236x": {"width": 236, "height": 248, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/236x/ac/43/dd/ac43dd186877815ca7af3c21cf2bac82.jpg"}, "474x": {"width": 450, "height": 474, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/474x/ac/43/dd/ac43dd186877815ca7af3c21cf2bac82.jpg"}, "736x": {"width": 450, "height": 474, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ac/43/dd/ac43dd186877815ca7af3c21cf2bac82.jpg"}, "orig": {"width": 450, "height": 474, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ac/43/dd/ac43dd186877815ca7af3c21cf2bac82.jpg"}}, "buyable_product": null, "type": "pin", "is_promoted": false, "attribution": null, "tracking_params": "CwABAAAAEDE5Mjg1OTU1MzUyMDk2NjMGAAMACAA", "ad_match_reason": 0}, {"is_eligible_for_web_closeup": false, "pinner": {"image_small_url": "https://i.pinimg.com/30x30_RS/31/2e/1a/312e1a3e4c755eb7e504d99ada03bfe1.jpg", "verified_identity": {}, "id": "31384666061671253", "username": "easythere", "follower_count": 2836, "full_name": "Sharon Jenna", "image_medium_url": "https://i.pinimg.com/75x75_RS/31/2e/1a/312e1a3e4c755eb7e504d99ada03bfe1.jpg"}, "dominant_color": "#ad825f", "is_uploaded": false, "rich_summary": {"apple_touch_icon_images": {"orig": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/1c856bfbc88c01872fc67521a406e56242d6fff37880c30e0f0f90e6.png?2e8e36985484153a3d85261393ad3a46"}, "favicon_link": "https://s.pinimg.com/images/default_rich_pin_favicon.png", "favicon_images": {"orig": "https://s.pinimg.com/images/default_rich_pin_favicon.png"}, "products": [], "display_name": "National Geographic Photo Contest 2012", "url": "http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2012/10/post.html", "site_name": "Boston.com", "display_description": "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that time again\u00e2\u0080\u00a6the 2012 National Geographic Photo Contest is in full swing.

These flowering ornamental trees perform well in a wide range of soil and climates in USDA growing from zones 5-8. They will grow in almost any soil type from clay to loamy and can tolerate moist or well draining soils. Slowly growing to a height of 20-30 feet tall and 20 feet wide, they bloom in the very early spring before most other spring trees, even when it can still seem winter like outside. These trees can grow in full sun, but prefer dappled shade. They\u2019re great not only for the spring flower show, but also their red fall foliage and bright red winter berries that attract a host of wildlife.</p> <p><strong>Location:</strong> Choose a planting site for your dogwood that receives light or filtered shade. dogwood trees are highly adaptable to many soil types but they thrive in moist, fertile soils high in organic matter. The soil of your planting site should be well draining with a 5.5 soil pH level.</p> <p><strong>Planting Instructions:<br></strong>1) Dig a planting hole for your dogwood that is three times the diameter of your tree\u2019s root ball and of equal depth.<br>2) Remove your dogwood from its container and ensure good root moisture.<br>3) Place your tree in the planting hole, keeping the top of the root ball even with the ground.<br>4) Adjust your tree\u2019s position/angle then use the original soil to back fill the planting hole.<br>5) Spread the roots out evenly and surround them with soil, tamping down lightly as you fill to avoid air pockets, which can dry out the roots of your tree.<br>6) Avoid firming the soil at this point, instead water the area immediately to settle the soil.<br>7) Mulch around the base of the tree to conserve soil moisture. This will also keep competing growth (grass and weeds) from growing around the planting site.</p> <p><strong>Watering:</strong> dogwood trees possess very shallow root systems that are susceptible to drying out in the absence of regular rainfall. It\u2019s best to water your tree once or twice a week. Be sure to water correctly, light green leaves are a sign of over watering while drooping leaves signify both over and under watering. Watch for these and any other signs that your tree is getting too much or too little water.</p> <p><strong>Fertilization:</strong> dogwood trees do not require much fertilization. If you choose to fertilize, do so sparingly in April or May. Any general purpose fertilizer is suitable for this.</p> <p><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Do not permit weeds or grasses any closer than 2-3 feet from your dogwood in the first year. Pull the weeds initially, and then utilize a growing mat or mulch. Insulate the roots 2-4 inches and replenish as needed. <strong>Do not</strong> spray RoundUp on a young dogwood and ensure that wind doesn't blow chemical drift onto your tree.</p> <p><strong>Pests & Disease:</strong> The best defense against any pest or disease issue is a healthy tree. Good soil, proper feeding & healthy watering habits are vital to the prosperity of your tree.</p> <p><strong>Deer:</strong> If you believe that deer may become an issue for your dogwood, consider caging the tree(s). Although there is a whole host of deer deterrents available, nothing will guarantee protection like caging will.</p> <p><strong>Winter Dormancy:</strong> During late fall and winter, your dogwood will enter its dormant state.

Great for soaking up standing water or wet areas Provides excellent shade over your patio or yard  Never Bareroot... All plants come rooted into a container with soil. Description The Weeping Willow Tree is a graceful and refined shade tree with long, ground-sweeping branches. This beautiful shade tree will grow to astounding heights and will do so at a very accelerated rate. Reaching heights of 30\u2019 to 40\u2019 and a mature width of 35\u2019 this tree will provide a cool shady oasis for hot summer days. Willow trees have pretty green foliage that can be characterized as long and thin shaped leaves. They are one of the first to produce foliage in the spring and one of the last trees to drop yellow/green leaves in the fall. How To Care When planting your Weeping Willow tree be sure you have the right location and conditions for your new tree to thrive. Spring and Fall are ideal times to plant. However, if you avoid extreme temperatures you can plant your Willow tree almost any time of the year. Weeping Willows thrive in full sun to part shade and are adaptable to almost any\u00a0soil\u00a0as long as it isn't dry. Water deeply 2-3 times weekly for the first 3 months after planting. This helps the tree's roots establish properly. You want to continue to keep the ground moist, especially for the first 2 years. Try using a Treegator and/or adding 2-3 inches of mulch to your young tree to reduce hand watering needs. Examine the leaves regularly to address any signs of over watering or under watering. Falling of leaves can be a sign of under watering. Weeping Willows are great for areas with standing water. Water your mature tree in dry periods. Otherwise, the water requirements are greatly reduced once your tree has been in the ground about 2 years. If your tree needs a boost, fertilize in early spring with a basic slow release fertilizer. Weeping Willows don't generally require pruning, but, if needed, prune when they are dormant in winter or early spring to remove any dead, dying, or crowded branches, or to maintain shape. The Weeping Willow is deer tolerant. The best way to prevent disease and pests is by providing the appropriate care for your plants. Proper location choice, watering, and\u00a0fertilization\u00a0are the keys to your success. Weeping Willows rarely have issues with pests or disease. Occasionally, Scale and Aphids can affect Willows. You can treat these pests naturally with horticultural oil, neem oil, or insecticidal soap. For severe infections you can use pesticides like carbaryl, also known as Sevin. Fungal issues can arise on occasion. Generally, treating after infection isn't extremely effective, so if you have problems yearly treat in early spring with fungicides to prevent infection.

The Weeping Willow will absorb all that extra water and provide shade in the process. These trees are great to plant beside ponds and lakes because of their love for excess water. Even though these trees are normally found near bodies of water, they will thrive in almost any condition and display some tolerance to drought.Weeping Willow trees are very adaptable to different types of soils and growing conditions and can even help minimize soil erosion.

Shipping Dates Ships November through April Description Black Oak Tree - Quercus velutina\u00a0\u00a0For Sale Affordable, Grower Direct Prices Tennessee Wholesale Nursery Black Oak Tree deriving its name from the dark, deeply grooved nearly black bark of older trees, younger Black Oak trees may appear gray in color. They are distinguishable from its relative the red oak by deep green leaves with seven to nine pointed lobes rather than the rounded lobes of the red oak. A medium to large tree, the black oak can attain heights of 80 feet, although soil conditions will affect the tree's development. In the wild, it begins to produce acorns at about 20 years with a life span of 100 to 500 years. The Black Oak is found throughout the eastern United States north of Florida. Its exceptionally deep tap root gives it the ability to withstand drought and poor soil better than some other varieties, but it does not tolerate shade well and is difficult to transplant. Its primary use is as a shade tree grown in place. Fall foliage ranges from dull red to orange-brown, and the Black Oak can tolerate cold winters down to USDA Zone 3. Buy Fast Growing Black Oaks\u00a0 This tree grows best in moist soils. The Black Oak starts creating acorns at age two. This tree can be three feet per year. This tree is fantastic and produces large leaves that help provide lots of shade during the spring and summer. They can grow to become seventy to eighty feet tall when fully mature and look amazing. During the autumn the foliage changes to a golden in color and provide lots of bright colors. They grow best because they can adapt well to all different types of soil conditions. They bloom during the spring and early part of summer. They produce huge canopies, so they need lots of room to grow and mature into healthy and beautiful trees. This tree is terrific at the wildlife that it brings in. The squirrels love playing in the long branches of this tree and also like to dine on the acorns that it produces. It is also great to attract a wide variety of birds to an area. These trees are robust and can withstand lots of harsh weather conditions. They make an outstanding addition to all lawns and landscapes and bring lots of vivid color to all areas where they are planted.\u00a0 Affordable Black Oak Tree For Every Landscape \u00a0"}, "is_eligible_for_web_closeup": false, "image_signature": "7fa17f90ad6a953804e11118a0a3dcd7", "promoter": null, "buyable_product": null, "is_prefetch_enabled": false, "domain": "tnnursery.net", "access": [], "story_pin_data_id": null, "ad_match_reason": 0, "dominant_color": "#859556", "did_its": [], "shopping_flags": [8, 1, 11, 6], "board": {"url": "/bspencer2007/my-future-home/", "name": "My future home"}, "debug_info_html": null}, {"grid_title": "Disney\u2019s Artemis Fowl | Official Trailer", "image_crop": {"min_y": 0, "max_y": 1}, "tracking_params": "CwABAAAAEDU3MjkzNTMzMTMyOTU1MDcGAAMACAA", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl2r3Fwxz_o&feature=youtu.be", "carousel_data": null, "title": "Disney\u2019s Artemis Fowl | Official Trailer ", "has_required_attribution_provider": true, "id": "AenXtQhqBVriqAUB0oYjZK_r2ee-pOHuFF8tM0q-g13fcbwh8bkt_AKwsttCFHda0x9IhKb7A-tUq1HAtOx5XsM", "type": "pin", "is_uploaded": true, "embed": null, "created_at": "Mon, 02 Mar 2020 09:00:22 +0000", "pinner": {"username": "disneystudios", "full_name": "Walt Disney Studios", "follower_count": 100675, "verified_identity": {"name": "disneystudios", "verified": true}, "image_medium_url": "https://i.pinimg.com/75x75_RS/2a/c2/97/2ac297d0b59438e19b68a2e8ede9337e.jpg", "id": "235524392921077454", "image_small_url": "https://i.pinimg.com/30x30_RS/2a/c2/97/2ac297d0b59438e19b68a2e8ede9337e.jpg"}, "is_downstream_promotion": false, "description": "Remember the name.

It is a fast-growing tree that is a great choice for wetter conditions and clay soils, but it will grow well in regular soil too. It will resist the poor air of urban conditions and do well on compacted soil as well. Pin Oak makes a broad shade-tree that has a rounded crown and turns attractive shades of reddish-bronze in fall, a lovely contrast to the colors of other trees at that season.

The genus includes about 50 species. The name is also applied to several tree species of the genera Machaerium and Dalbergia in the pea family (see legume), the sources of commercial rosewood. The blue flowers of the Jacaranda tree adorn the streets of many African cities, such as: Pretoria \u2013 the Jacaranda City. Jacaranda mimosifolia are spectacular late spring flowering trees, which create washes of purple through many towns and suburbs each spring.

Planting: </strong>Though it's tolerant of soggy soils, October Glory prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure (at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily). When you're ready to plant, dig a hole three times the width of the root ball and as deep. Plant the root ball in the hole and backfill with enriched, loose soil. Water thoroughly after the root ball has been established and place a layer of thick protective mulching over the topsoil to control for weeds, pests, and suckers.</p> <p><strong>2. Watering: </strong>The October Glory Maple will appreciate a minimum of one and a half inches of water per week, whether from rainfall or irrigation. This translates to about one thorough watering from the garden hose each week (water for about 30 seconds to 1 minute).</p> <p><strong>3. Fertilizing: </strong>Use a slow-release fertilizer in a 10-10-10 formula twice per month during the growing season. Cease fertilizing when the tree is nearing its dormancy stage.</p>"}, "is_eligible_for_web_closeup": false, "image_signature": "89db73c15634ad9367ac519dfeffe4d7", "promoter": null, "buyable_product": null, "is_prefetch_enabled": false, "domain": "fast-growing-trees.com", "access": [], "story_pin_data_id": null, "ad_match_reason": 0, "dominant_color": "#ca6b25", "did_its": [], "shopping_flags": [8, 1, 11, 6], "board": {"url": "/mirandamalone95/moving-to-beulah/", "name": "Moving to Beulah "}, "debug_info_html": null}, {"grid_title": "Yoshino Cherry Tree", "image_crop": {"min_y": 0, "max_y": 1}, "tracking_params": "CwABAAAAEDU3MjkzNTMzMTMyOTU1MDcGAAMACAA", "link": "https://www.plantingtree.com/products/yoshino-cherry-tree", "carousel_data": null, "title": "", "has_required_attribution_provider": false, "id": "376965431313411876", "type": "pin", "is_uploaded": false, "embed": null, "created_at": "Tue, 25 Feb 2020 20:01:06 +0000", "pinner": {"username": "katiemeehan980", "full_name": "Katie Meehan", "follower_count": 30, "verified_identity": {}, "image_medium_url": "https://i.pinimg.com/75x75_RS/5e/d9/fb/5ed9fb1aeb6367abc402189f896cc08b.jpg", "id": "376965568718204100", "image_small_url": "https://i.pinimg.com/30x30_RS/5e/d9/fb/5ed9fb1aeb6367abc402189f896cc08b.jpg"}, "is_downstream_promotion": false, "description": " ", "attribution": null, "images": {"170x": {"width": 170, "height": 170, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/170x/cd/59/44/cd594452670662ae10e846241a9f5001.jpg"}, "236x": {"width": 236, "height": 236, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/236x/cd/59/44/cd594452670662ae10e846241a9f5001.jpg"}, "474x": {"width": 448, "height": 448, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/474x/cd/59/44/cd594452670662ae10e846241a9f5001.jpg"}, "736x": {"width": 448, "height": 448, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/cd/59/44/cd594452670662ae10e846241a9f5001.jpg"}, "orig": {"width": 448, "height": 448, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cd/59/44/cd594452670662ae10e846241a9f5001.jpg"}}, "videos": null, "is_promoted": false, "promoted_is_removable": false, "aggregated_pin_data": {}, "reaction_counts": {}, "rich_summary": {"apple_touch_icon_images": null, "favicon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/9b09da08972686a6b21a78b7d1f3bed7cab538cf357a99a98edc9a64.png?4bf4d6229ed14efb3e02361b5b536d65", "products": [{"name": "Yoshino Cherry Tree", "id": "140147274228752", "type": "richproductmetadata", "offers": [{"availability": 1, "price_currency": "USD", "price_value": 95.99, "name": null, "id": "140147274230608", "type": "offermetadata", "in_stock": true}], "purchase_url": null, "offer_summary": {"price": "$95.99", "in_stock": true, "availability": 1}}], "url": "https://www.plantingtree.com/products/yoshino-cherry-tree", "favicon_images": {"orig": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/9b09da08972686a6b21a78b7d1f3bed7cab538cf357a99a98edc9a64.png?4bf4d6229ed14efb3e02361b5b536d65"}, "id": "38e3868716aaa875880b2d51862244e4", "type": "richpingriddata", "site_name": "PlantingTree.com", "actions": [], "apple_touch_icon_link": null, "type_name": "product", "display_name": "Yoshino Cherry Tree", "display_description": "Introduction Blossoms Burst Open Early Spring!  Most popular Flowering Cherry Tree Featured at the National Cherry Blossom Festival Your neighbors will ask \"What is that tree?\" Adds great spring color to any landscape. Amazing focal tree   Description Looking to add beauty and elegance to your yard? The Yoshino Cherry does just that. It is considered one of the most beautiful, flowering ornamental trees. No doubt about it...this gorgeous tree will turn heads! The Yoshino Cherry is one of the showiest Flowering Cherry trees. The flowers bloom before the foliage appears. An abundance of delicate white to pink flowers with a light, almond fragrance appear around mid March. Your landscape will stun all who pass. The leaves of the Yoshino Cherry are a glossy dark green that will turn yellow in the fall. Like all flowering trees, the Yoshino is partial to full sunlight and well drained soil. Starting off as a fast grower, the Yoshino will reach between 10-15 feet in the first 3 to 4 years. As the tree matures the growth rate slows down. You can expect your Yoshino Cherry to reach between 20 to 30 feet at maturity. It\u2019s arching branches reach about 20 feet wide. The Yoshino Cherry is featured alongside its cousin the Kwanzan Cherry at the Cherry Blossom Festivals in both Washington D.C. and Macon, Georgia each spring. These magnificent treasures line the streets of D.C. and attract a huge crowd from all over the world. Why not add this popular tree to your own yard? These fast growing, medium stature trees are easy to use in any landscape. Small yards could be greatly enhanced by using the compact Yoshino Cherry. The Yoshino Cherry can either be used as a specimen or grouped together with other trees to make a spectacular addition to your landscape. Don't forget its beauty at night. Place an uplight under each tree and be dazzled all night long.Be sure to read our\u00a0Yoshino Cherry Tree Guide\u00a0for additional information. How To Care When planting your Yoshino Cherry tree be sure you have the right location and conditions for your new tree to thrive. Spring and fall are ideal times to plant. However, if you avoid freezing temperatures and extreme heat you can plant your Flowering Cherry tree almost any time of the year. Yoshino Flowering Cherry trees thrive in full sun and are extremely adaptable to any soil as long as it is well drained. Water deeply when planting and twice weekly for about 3 months while your new tree is establishing. Once your tree is established you will only need to water during dry periods. When the soil is dry(and especially in high temperatures) water deeply once or twice weekly as needed to keep the soil moist. Adding a layer of mulch is recommended especially with newly planted trees. This will help keep the soil moist and cool in summer and protect the roots in winter as well. Do not allow the mulch to touch the trunk as this increases the chances of pests and disease. Fertilize in early spring and when planting to give your tree a boost. Choose a\u00a0balanced, slow release fertilizer. Pruning is not recommended for ornamental Cherry trees, but, if needed, prune in winter or early spring to remove any dead, dying, or crowded branches.\u00a0 For more tips check out our article on\u00a0Shade tree care. The best way to prevent disease and pests is by providing the appropriate care for your plants. Proper location choice, watering, and fertilization are the keys to your success. Scale, Aphids and Mites are insects that can affect Flowering Cherry trees. You can treat these pests naturally with horticultural oil, neem oil, or insecticidal soap. For severe infections you can use pesticides like carbaryl, also known as Sevin. Tent Caterpillars and Cankerworms are sometimes an issue for Flowering Cherry Trees. These can be treated with an organic pesticide spray, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Occasionally fungal issues can arise. Generally, treating after infection isn't extremely effective, so if you have problems yearly treat in early spring with fungicides to prevent infection. Neem Oil is an organic method of treating and preventing some fungal diseases and pests. It can be effective, but the entire tree must be coated in order for this method to be effective. Landscape Ideas Plant your Yoshino Cherry in your front yard, and make an island out of the bed. Add a boulder in the front off to the side of the cherry tree, and use some soft touch holly shrubs on the sides. Or just plant your Flowering Cherry Tree in the front yard. Almost anywhere around your home this tree can be used. It is a perfect focal tree to pull your landscape together. Plant in an area where you can see it from your window. So you can enjoy its blooms from the inside.

The tree's nickname, 'American Walnut' is no fluke. Our forefathers adorned their homes, crafted barns and built fences with wood made from the black walnut. <strong>The leaflets, as large as some trees leaves, are dwarfed by the leaves themselve</strong>s, which can grow up to a mammoth two feet long. And let's not forget the nut.<br> <br> <strong>The thick, black husk that gives the tree its name serves as ample protection for a round, savory fruit packed with flavor.</strong> The tree yields a nut so rich and delicious,<strong> it can be enjoyed right out of the shell, baked in deserts or crushed and topped on your favorite ice cream.</strong> With an abundant autumn harvest, a single tree can produce hundreds of nuts in just one season.<br> <br> <strong>How to Keep your Black Walnut Healthy</strong><br> <br> The main thing to remember when caring for your Black Walnut tree is to keep weeds and grasses under control in the planting area because they will limit walnut growth. For quality wood production and to maximize walnut yields, use corrective and clear stem pruning methods. Fertilizer containing trace amounts of zinc aids in fruit growth and can be applied every other year. To help ensure branch health, don't pick nuts directly from the tree. Simply shake the branches up and down and enjoy a healthy shower of delicious nuts for many years to come.</p> <!-- split --> <h2>Planting & Care</h2> <p>The Black Walnut tree (<em>Juglans nigra</em>) or \u201cAmerican Walnut\u201d is a moderately growing, cold tolerant nut producing tree that is not only sought for it\u2019s bountiful walnut harvest but also the dark, beautiful brown wood. They are commonly planted in USDA growing zones 4-9 which means they can not only take the cold but a good amount of heat as well. The Black Walnut tree will mature to a gargantuan height of 70-150 feet tall and as much as 30-40 feet wide so make sure there are no obstructions for the tree to grow such as power lines. This full sun loving, moderate grower produces an abundant harvest in the fall around September to October, simply shake the branches and be ready for a showering of delicious walnuts!</p> <p><strong>Seasonal Information: </strong>Generally it is best to plant your tree in the early fall, at least six weeks before the first frost in order to give the roots enough time to become established before winter sets in, or in the early spring six weeks after the final frost. However, you can plant your tree at any time of the year as long as your ground isn\u2019t frozen. If you plant during the summer simply make sure that your trees get enough water to balance the heat.</p> <p><strong>Location: </strong>When deciding where to plant your walnut trees remember that they will perform best in full sunlight. Although, they can tolerate partial shade as long as they have at least six hours of direct sunlight a day. Avoid planting these nutty trees in an area of your yard that\u2019s prone to flooding, or that collects standing water. Also, account for your tree\u2019s massive size. Give it enough space from structures so it can reach its mature width, and don\u2019t plant them under power lines.</p> <p><strong>Planting directions:</strong><strong><br></strong>1) Once you have picked the perfect planting location dig a hole that\u2019s just as deep as the root ball on your tree and three times as wide.<br>2) Take a pitch fork or shovel and scrape it along the sides of the hole to loosen the soil. Check for any debris like rocks, grass, or dirt clumps and remove them from the hole.<br>3) Next place your tree in the hole and make sure that it\u2019s level with the surrounding ground and standing straight upwards at a 90 degree angle.<br>4) Slowly back fill the hole and gently tamp the soil down.<br>5) Once you\u2019ve completed the planting process give your tree a long drink of water and mulch the area to conserve soil moisture.</p> <p><strong>Watering: </strong>We often find that plants are harmed more by over watering than under watering. Keep this in mind when it comes to watering your walnut tree. Allow the soil to dry out two inches below the surface before watering your trees. When it\u2019s time to give your trees more water hold a hose to their bases and count to 30 seconds in order to give them a slow, deep watering.</p> <p><strong>Fertilization: </strong>In order to give your walnut trees a boost give them some well balanced fertilizer like formula 10-10-10 twice a year. Once in the early spring and again in the early fall. If your soil is lacking in nutrients you can fertilize up to once a month during the growing season. Always remember to wait until your tree has experienced one year of growth before fertilizing.</p> <p><strong>Weed Control: </strong>Prevent weeds from growing under the canopy by spreading 3 to 4 inch thick layer of mulch around the base. The mulch won\u2019t allow weeds to grow, and it will also help your soil retain moisture. If you spot some weeds that need removing you can remove them by taking a firm grasp on them and pulling them upwards out of the ground in a twisting motion.</p> <p><strong>Pollination: </strong>Most Walnut varieties are self-fertile. They have both male and female flowers on a single tree. The female flowers open and wait for pollen to be spread from the male flowers, relying on natural pollinators like the wind and bees to make sure the pollen is spread from point A to point B. This being said pollination often has better chances if you have two or more trees for pollen to spread from.</p> <p><strong>Pruning: </strong>During the early spring is the best time of year to prune your walnut trees. You will want to prune any broken, damaged, or diseased branches. Also, remove any crisscrossing or rubbing branches. Make sure that your tree has sunlight and air flow through the canopy, this will allow the air and sunlight to knock out molds and fungi.</p> <p>Be sure to look at your tree and plan where to make your cuts. Just like with a haircut, you can always remove more hair later, but if you cut too much it may take a while to grow back. Use a sharp and sterile pair of hand pruners or loppers and make your cuts at 45 degree angles facing upwards in order to promote new growth.</p>", "url": "https://www.fast-growing-trees.com/products/black-walnut-tree", "type": "richpingriddata", "favicon_images": {"orig": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/741dbd60a816f4b2f97fc7d927577901289074790ea6fd63cabbd77c.png?70a11917ac955e94626c72b63ac898a5"}, "favicon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/741dbd60a816f4b2f97fc7d927577901289074790ea6fd63cabbd77c.png?70a11917ac955e94626c72b63ac898a5", "apple_touch_icon_images": {"orig": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/d7ef078ae91d94931c0f499a118cf511d8cce83d38508162c422cdeb.png?7cbf8dcce24b7ae67280952669007b1a"}, "actions": []}, "aggregated_pin_data": {}, "images": {"170x": {"width": 170, "height": 113, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/170x/8b/b1/bf/8bb1bf3827e5e596639ab4975e5dae19.jpg"}, "236x": {"width": 236, "height": 157, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/236x/8b/b1/bf/8bb1bf3827e5e596639ab4975e5dae19.jpg"}, "474x": {"width": 450, "height": 300, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/474x/8b/b1/bf/8bb1bf3827e5e596639ab4975e5dae19.jpg"}, "736x": {"width": 450, "height": 300, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/8b/b1/bf/8bb1bf3827e5e596639ab4975e5dae19.jpg"}, "orig": {"width": 450, "height": 300, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8b/b1/bf/8bb1bf3827e5e596639ab4975e5dae19.jpg"}}, "dominant_color": "#a5b890", "is_uploaded": false, "did_its": [], "story_pin_data_id": null, "is_prefetch_enabled": false, "has_required_attribution_provider": false, "promoted_is_removable": false, "attribution": null, "promoter": null, "link": "https://www.fast-growing-trees.com/products/black-walnut-tree", "carousel_data": null, "created_at": "Thu, 27 Feb 2020 14:28:14 +0000", "tracking_params": "CwABAAAAEDA0NDU5Nzk0NDY4MjY2NjYGAAMACAA", "shopping_flags": [8, 1, 11, 6], "id": "680817668656205005", "is_eligible_for_web_closeup": false, "ad_match_reason": 0, "embed": null, "title": "", "description": " ", "is_downstream_promotion": false, "domain": "fast-growing-trees.com", "pinner": {"verified_identity": {}, "follower_count": 3, "image_medium_url": "https://s.pinimg.com/images/user/default_75.png", "image_small_url": "https://s.pinimg.com/images/user/default_30.png", "full_name": "Keegan Thompson", "id": "680817806077505956", "username": "keegancthompson"}, "access": [], "image_signature": "8bb1bf3827e5e596639ab4975e5dae19", "type": "pin", "image_crop": {"min_y": 0, "max_y": 1}, "videos": null, "debug_info_html": null}, {"reaction_counts": {}, "board": {"name": "Erikas house of dreams \u2764\ufe0f", "url": "/ebox2016/erikas-house-of-dreams/"}, "grid_title": "Weeping Willow Tree", "is_promoted": false, "buyable_product": null, "rich_summary": {"site_name": "PlantingTree.com", "apple_touch_icon_link": null, "display_name": "Weeping Willow Tree", "id": "ec25c2e0407a23bfd4b1c1bc1957f682", "products": [{"name": "Weeping Willow Tree", "type": "richproductmetadata", "purchase_url": null, "offers": [{"name": null, "type": "offermetadata", "price_value": 69.99, "in_stock": true, "id": "140318405339600", "availability": 1, "price_currency": "USD"}], "id": "140318410760400", "offer_summary": {"price": "$69.99", "in_stock": true, "availability": 1}}], "type_name": "product", "display_description": "Introduction A True American Classic  Fastest growing weeping tree that brings your shade and comfort to your home. Great for soaking up standing water or wet areas Provides excellent shade over your patio or yard  Never Bareroot... All plants come rooted into a container with soil. Description The Weeping Willow Tree is a graceful and refined shade tree with long, ground-sweeping branches. This beautiful shade tree will grow to astounding heights and will do so at a very accelerated rate. Reaching heights of 30\u2019 to 40\u2019 and a mature width of 35\u2019 this tree will provide a cool shady oasis for hot summer days. Willow trees have pretty green foliage that can be characterized as long and thin shaped leaves. They are one of the first to produce foliage in the spring and one of the last trees to drop yellow/green leaves in the fall. How To Care When planting your Weeping Willow tree be sure you have the right location and conditions for your new tree to thrive. Spring and Fall are ideal times to plant. However, if you avoid extreme temperatures you can plant your Willow tree almost any time of the year. Weeping Willows thrive in full sun to part shade and are adaptable to almost any\u00a0soil\u00a0as long as it isn't dry. Water deeply 2-3 times weekly for the first 3 months after planting. This helps the tree's roots establish properly. You want to continue to keep the ground moist, especially for the first 2 years. Try using a Treegator and/or adding 2-3 inches of mulch to your young tree to reduce hand watering needs. Examine the leaves regularly to address any signs of over watering or under watering. Falling of leaves can be a sign of under watering. Weeping Willows are great for areas with standing water. Water your mature tree in dry periods. Otherwise, the water requirements are greatly reduced once your tree has been in the ground about 2 years. If your tree needs a boost, fertilize in early spring with a basic slow release fertilizer. Weeping Willows don't generally require pruning, but, if needed, prune when they are dormant in winter or early spring to remove any dead, dying, or crowded branches, or to maintain shape. The Weeping Willow is deer tolerant. The best way to prevent disease and pests is by providing the appropriate care for your plants. Proper location choice, watering, and\u00a0fertilization\u00a0are the keys to your success. Weeping Willows rarely have issues with pests or disease. Occasionally, Scale and Aphids can affect Willows. You can treat these pests naturally with horticultural oil, neem oil, or insecticidal soap. For severe infections you can use pesticides like carbaryl, also known as Sevin. Fungal issues can arise on occasion. Generally, treating after infection isn't extremely effective, so if you have problems yearly treat in early spring with fungicides to prevent infection. Landscape Ideas One of the great characteristics of a Willow Tree is its ability to soak up excess water. Have a problem area in your landscape where standing water is being a nuisance? The Weeping Willow will absorb all that extra water and provide shade in the process. These trees are great to plant beside ponds and lakes because of their love for excess water. Even though these trees are normally found near bodies of water, they will thrive in almost any condition and display some tolerance to drought.Weeping Willow trees are very adaptable to different types of soils and growing conditions and can even help minimize soil erosion. The Weeping Willow tree is sure to enchant your landscape with its beautiful and sweeping branches.

Bought the 5-6 foot version and it was \"bent\" in half when it arrived, so I was a bit concerned. It had some leaves on it. Planted it on my property with a stake to straighten it. Several months later, the tree is flourishing! It's grown significantly (I tied a bow on the tree where it met the top of the stake so I could see if it grew taller). It's grown taller, lots of new branches, and full of leaves. I absolutely love it and can't wait to watch it get bigger and bigger! Helpful Gardening Tips Click here to view our blog.

Some 400 different species of willows exist today, ranging in size from shrubs to towering trees with arching, overhanging branches.\u00a0 \u00a0 A Historically Important Plant \u00a0 \u00a0People have cultivated willow trees for thousands of years. The plant's bark contains ingredients which ultimately contributed to the development of aspirin, a necessary over-the-counter pain relief medication. Some butterfly species rely on the willow as an essential food source. Additionally, many cultivars of the Weeping Willow Tree provide vital seasonal nutrition for honey bee colonies during early Spring. (In parts of North America, some willows begin developing leaves as early as February.) \u00a0 The Weeping Willow Tree: Visually Stunning \u00a0 \u00a0The Weeping Willow Tree possesses a characteristic appearance. It creates an umbrella-like canopy, its limbs covered with hanging leafy branches that arch outwards distinctively from the trunk. Leaves develop laterally along every branch; no terminal buds form. The light green foliage assumes an attractive yellowish-gold color during autumn.\u00a0 \u00a0 Growing Conditions \u00a0 \u00a0These rapidly growing trees survive from Zone 3 through Zone 10. They range in height from 50 to 82 feet. Most varieties endure between 40 and 75 years.", "url": "https://www.tnnursery.net/weeping-willow-trees-for-sale/", "type": "richpingriddata", "favicon_images": {"orig": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/18951c260d5bbd0880691b6f67728ddfc83c308991cd1cf91389a2fb.png?e75624733c2ef3c1fb4c2a4b25c6a49c"}, "favicon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/18951c260d5bbd0880691b6f67728ddfc83c308991cd1cf91389a2fb.png?e75624733c2ef3c1fb4c2a4b25c6a49c", "apple_touch_icon_images": {"orig": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/424cf471b117a4c98b2b2a3fd659e535aed815bde7821f8e95c17503.png?bf943b2b91275cb188d856750ff7295d"}, "actions": []}, "aggregated_pin_data": {}, "images": {"170x": {"width": 170, "height": 127, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/170x/89/af/4a/89af4a44d8fe7f3df860e520cd7f3702.jpg"}, "236x": {"width": 236, "height": 177, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/236x/89/af/4a/89af4a44d8fe7f3df860e520cd7f3702.jpg"}, "474x": {"width": 474, "height": 355, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/474x/89/af/4a/89af4a44d8fe7f3df860e520cd7f3702.jpg"}, "736x": {"width": 500, "height": 375, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/89/af/4a/89af4a44d8fe7f3df860e520cd7f3702.jpg"}, "orig": {"width": 500, "height": 375, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/89/af/4a/89af4a44d8fe7f3df860e520cd7f3702.jpg"}}, "dominant_color": "#676c45", "is_uploaded": false, "did_its": [], "story_pin_data_id": null, "is_prefetch_enabled": false, "has_required_attribution_provider": false, "promoted_is_removable": false, "attribution": null, "promoter": null, "link": "https://www.tnnursery.net/weeping-willow-trees-for-sale/", "carousel_data": null, "created_at": "Thu, 27 Feb 2020 19:29:50 +0000", "tracking_params": "CwABAAAAEDA0NDU5Nzk0NDY4MjY2NjYGAAMACAA", "shopping_flags": [8, 1, 11, 6], "id": "601863937689812773", "is_eligible_for_web_closeup": false, "ad_match_reason": 0, "embed": null, "title": "", "description": " ", "is_downstream_promotion": false, "domain": "tnnursery.net", "pinner": {"verified_identity": {}, "follower_count": 0, "image_medium_url": "https://s.pinimg.com/images/user/default_75.png", "image_small_url": "https://s.pinimg.com/images/user/default_30.png", "full_name": "Ali Lebeko", "id": "601864075110179575", "username": "alilebeko"}, "access": [], "image_signature": "89af4a44d8fe7f3df860e520cd7f3702", "type": "pin", "image_crop": {"min_y": 0, "max_y": 1}, "videos": null, "debug_info_html": null}, {"reaction_counts": {}, "board": {"name": "Planting trees for climate change", "url": "/LucidPublishing/planting-trees-for-climate-change/"}, "grid_title": "Gnarled Roots - Textural Woodland Nature Photo - Sycamore Tree Roots by the River Print", "is_promoted": false, "buyable_product": null, "rich_summary": {"site_name": "Etsy", "apple_touch_icon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/fb7d72f4731f6cfba3c3e3928fe9656703ed7deae75c5c897e8c060d.png?f034d3b136059c33431447bb116b5f77", "display_name": "Gnarled Roots - Textural Woodland Nature Photo - Sycamore Tree Roots by the River Print", "id": "8a9581e9c227a09f507ac97f07fad342", "products": [{"name": "Gnarled Roots - Textural Woodland Nature Photo - Sycamore Tree Roots by the River Print", "type": "richproductmetadata", "purchase_url": null, "offers": [{"name": null, "type": "offermetadata", "price_value": 8, "in_stock": true, "id": "140319408289296", "availability": 1, "price_currency": "GBP"}], "id": "140319408288848", "offer_summary": {"price": "\u00a38", "in_stock": true, "availability": 1}}], "type_name": "product", "display_description": "T I T L E: Gnarled RootsPhotograph by Lisa BaldwinThis old sycamore tree grows on bank of the Tennessee River sending it's gnarled roots over cliffs of rock and moss into the river for a long drink.This fine art photograph is unmated and unframed.

Named because they grow upward in a tight column, this ginkgo will grow about 6-8 ft. wide and around 20 ft. tall. If you've never seen a ginkgo leaf, they are one of the most beautiful leaves of any tree. They will add an exotic appeal to any garden or yard. Ginkgo trees grow a uniform light green in the spring and darken up slightly in the summer. In the fall ginkgo trees have consistent golden leaves. The color is outstanding and can rival any other tree for fall beauty. Combine these with red maples, dogwoods, or a purple leave cherry for an amazing display.All 'Sky Tower' Ginkgo Trees are of a male selection - meaning they will not produce fruit. These trees are very hardy and have withstood the test of time. The ginkgo is literally 270 million years old, making it one of the most ancient and successful trees. When caring for these trees we recommend maintaining the usual mulch ring to protect the tree from elements, competing plants, and yard equipment for the first few years. Slow release fertilizer can be applied (per directions on the bag) in the early fall to give the tree a boost that will carry through to spring.

Place your tree and begin backfilling the hole, tamping down as you go to prevent air pockets.

Finally, water the tree well to saturate the entire planting area.</p> <p><strong>2. Watering:</strong><span> </span>Water the Jacaranda Tree once or twice weekly while it's establishing. Once established, the trees will only need water during times of extreme drought.</p> <p><strong>3. Fertilizing:</strong><span> </span>Jacaranda Trees need very little fertilizer, but if you want to speed up growth, you<span> </span>can use a well balanced, slow-release formula, such a 10-10-10, in early spring.</p> <p><strong>4.

Shipping Dates Ships November through April Description Sour wood\u00a0tree- Oxydendron Arboreum\u00a0\u00a0For Sale Affordable, Grower Direct Prices Tennessee Wholesale Nursery Sourwood trees are beautiful trees that bring their beauty in the heat of the summer months. These trees, unlike many others, do not bloom until the heat of summer. The blooms of the tree are large and white coming in small clusters. These little blooms are fragrant and accompany the thick green leaves. These trees turn in the fall into beacons of red, yellow and orange, looking like living fire. These trees also produce small grey seeds that can be eaten by birds and provide a winter food source. Sourwood, also known as the sorrel tree and scientifically referred to as Oxydendrum Arboreum, is a small tree or large shrub that grows 30 to 60 feet with the trunk measured at 20 inches in diameter. In rare cases, this species can extend heights over 30 meters and a width of 60 centimeters on very productive areas. The roots are superficial, and the tree grows best inland with little to no root adversaries. Buy Fast Growing Sour Wood Trees\u00a0 The leaves of Sourwood trees help eliminate the feeling of dry mouth, yet should not be swallowed. The bark of Sourwood trees is gray with a hint of red. It's profoundly furrowed and scaly in texture. Small branches are mild yellow-green at first but change to a red-brown when the tree matures. The wood is also red-brown, with lighter sapwood. The forest of these trees is very heavy, robust, and close-grained. The winter buds are feathered, small, and dark red. They are partly saturated on the bark. Internal scales increase in size when spring growth starts. Leaves are oblong and wedge-form at the base. During midyear, cream white flowers emerge in terminal panicles of secund racemes with a length of seven to eight inches. The fruit is a capsule-shaped, five-valved, and edged by a persistent style while the pedicels are showcased in a curved placement. Sourwood is suitably robust in the northern states of the country and a large ornamental tree on front lawns and parks. It's post-mature blooming makes it ideal, and its autumnal shading is exceptionally vibrant and awe-inspiring. The leaves are overly immersed with acid, and to some length manages the poise of those of the peach trees. The leaves can also be used as a laxative. The tree is well-recognized for nectar and the honey sourced from it. The blooms are extracted for its juice, which is used to make jelly. The tree shots were used by native Americans to devise arrow shafts. Sourwood trees are predominant within eastern North America, from south of Pennsylvania to the northwest of Florida. It is commonly found in the broader areas of the Appalachian Mountains. The species is also frequently seen as a part of the oak-heath forests. A growing Sourwood tree is invulnerable to any infestation, disease, or minor cultural dilemma it encounters as long as it gets the well-excavated, acid-rich land it needs. As said earlier, the roots are shallow and quickly disturbed; hence, it is advised to plant from premature, balled-and-burlapped stock. If you plan on replanting it, the best season would be Spring. Make sure it is well watered and mulched until the base is stable. Avoid planting the tree in overly polluted mediums that could prohibit their continuous growth and development. If the tree is planted correctly and maintained, it can grow fast and very hard. Fortunately, Sour-wood tree is elementary to take care of. Directly place it on acid-rich soil and water it every day.

By only growing to about 15 feet tall <strong>they can fit anywhere.</strong></p> <p>They are <strong>the perfect choice for planting in rows along a property border or close to structures like driveways or sidewalks</strong> because they won\u2019t take over space. However, with their unforgettable beauty, they are most often used as accent pieces or the main focal point of flowering gardens. </p> <p><strong>Snow Fountain Weeping Cherries have elegant arching branches that become covered in thousands of pure white blossoms every spring. </strong>The flowers cover the tree from top to bottom, causing it to look like a large water fountain that\u2019s completely frozen over.</p> <p><strong>During the warmer seasons, the canopy becomes filled with lush, glossy green leaves that turn vibrant shades of orange and gold in the fall.</strong> In the winter the Snow Fountain Weeping Cherry still displays color with its mahogany trunk that stands in the empty winter landscape.</p> <p><strong>The blossoms attract important pollinators like butterflies</strong> and your landscape, which are a delight to watch as they flutter from bloom to bloom. They will pollinate your Weeping Cherry tree as well as other flowering plants in your garden.</p> <p><strong>Low maintenance Snow Fountain Weeping Cherry Trees are a favorite among the north and snow because they\u2019re cold hardy and heat resistant.</strong> They are cold hardy to zone 5 and will flourish under heavy layers of ice and snow.

Remove your tree from its original container, position into the hole ensuring that it\u2019s standing upright, and the top of the root ball is even with the ground.</p> <p>Begin backfilling the hole, tamping down lightly as you go. Once the hole has been completely filled, water to allow the soil to settle and eliminate any air pockets. Finally, apply a 3 to 5-inch layer of mulch around the tree.</p> <p><strong>2. Watering:</strong><span> </span>We recommend watering these trees in the morning, at the base. If you\u2019re not sure when to water, simply check the top 2 inches of soil for dryness. If the soil is dry here, it\u2019s time to water your shrub.</p> <p><strong>3. Fertilizing: </strong>Apply a slow-release fertilizer once a year in early spring, before new growth emerges. Follow up by watering the surrounding soil to allow the fertilizer to penetrate into the roots.</p> <p><strong>4. Pruning: </strong><span>Minimal pruning is needed for these trees. Any broken branches can be pruned back in spring before new growth begins.</span></p>", "url":
