Shipping Dates Ships November through April Description Black Oak Tree - Quercus velutina\u00a0\u00a0For Sale Affordable, Grower Direct Prices Tennessee Wholesale Nursery Black Oak Tree deriving its name from the dark, deeply grooved nearly black bark of older trees, younger Black Oak trees may appear gray in color. They are distinguishable from its relative the red oak by deep green leaves with seven to nine pointed lobes rather than the rounded lobes of the red oak. A medium to large tree, the black oak can attain heights of 80 feet, although soil conditions will affect the tree's development. In the wild, it begins to produce acorns at about 20 years with a life span of 100 to 500 years. The Black Oak is found throughout the eastern United States north of Florida. Its exceptionally deep tap root gives it the ability to withstand drought and poor soil better than some other varieties, but it does not tolerate shade well and is difficult to transplant. Its primary use is as a shade tree grown in place. Fall foliage ranges from dull red to orange-brown, and the Black Oak can tolerate cold winters down to USDA Zone 3. Buy Fast Growing Black Oaks\u00a0 This tree grows best in moist soils. The Black Oak starts creating acorns at age two. This tree can be three feet per year. This tree is fantastic and produces large leaves that help provide lots of shade during the spring and summer. They can grow to become seventy to eighty feet tall when fully mature and look amazing. During the autumn the foliage changes to a golden in color and provide lots of bright colors. They grow best because they can adapt well to all different types of soil conditions. They bloom during the spring and early part of summer. They produce huge canopies, so they need lots of room to grow and mature into healthy and beautiful trees.

Description River Birch Tree was once called \"the most beautiful of trees\" by Prince Maximilian of Austria on a visit to the United States Also known as the red birch, black birch or water birch, these trees are native to the Southeastern United States. Their leaves are diamond shaped and double-toothed, and their leaves turn tallow in the fall. Early on, these trees have silvery gray bark that changes to pink, reddish-brown or black when the plant matures. Flowers bloom in the spring and winter, and small brown cones appear in the summer. River birches can grow several trunks. River Birch Tree is most notably an ornamental tree \u00a0 Its durability makes it easy for this tree to be used to create a variety of things, such as flatware, artificial limbs, and toys. River birch trees are also a source of food for wildlife such as birds and rodents (who eat its seeds). Deer eat this tree\u2019s twigs, and foliage and hummingbirds drink its sap. River birch trees tend to grow in wet environments, hence the name. They\u2019re usually found along river and stream banks, meaning they need very moist soil. Though they can tolerate drier soil, they do better when the soil is moist. Most people who have water on their properties surround it with river birch trees. \u00a0 River Birch Tree was popular among Native Americans for medical uses \u00a0 These trees are also suitable for producing shade. River birch trees can be planted as saplings or grown directly from the seed. The trees are known for their papery and peeling bark. These trees don\u2019t require much care once planted. Birch trees can also produce a fruit called \u201csamara,\u201d which can produce about 1 million seeds per year. Native Americans used river birch medicinally to treat dysentery and colds.

The Meyer Lemon is the ideal tree to grow in a pot and overwinter indoors. It will only grow 6 \u2013 8 feet tall and will thrive for many years in a pot. The fruit is deeper in color, juicer and a little sweeter than common lemons, making it ideal for homemade lemonade, lemon desserts and homemade sorbets. Your tree will flower and fruit even when young and has scented white flowers in spring and the round, deep yellow lemons are ripe from November to March.  \tPerfect size for long-term pot growing  \tTop quality fruit with unique flavor and full of juice  \tKeep indoors in winter, outdoors in summer  \tGreat tree for a glassed-in porch or sun-room  \tEasily grown and problem-free If you are fortunate to live in a warm area, this tree will of course also grow well outdoors, but the good news is that for almost everyone, the Meyer Lemon brings the ability to grow your own citrus into every home, no matter where you live.

Planting:</strong> Plant your Weeping Willow in full sun to partial shade (any area with about 4 to 8 hours of sunlight per day), select a site with well-drained soil, and space at least 35 feet from your septic system or leach field. When you're ready to plant, dig a hole three times the width and just as deep as the root ball on your tree. Place your tree in the hole, straighten it, gently back fill the soil and tamp it down. After this process is complete, give your tree a long drink of water until the soil becomes moist.</p> <p>Spreading a layer of mulch that\u2019s about three inches thick around the base of your tree will help the soil retain moisture and prevent weeds from growing.</p> <p><strong>2. Watering:</strong> You should regularly water your Weeping Willow for the first year to keep soil evenly moist (about once or twice weekly). Water your Willow only during dry periods in successive years. Although Weeping Willows prefer moist soil, they adapt easily to drier soil.</p> <p><strong>3. Fertilizing:</strong> Choose a brand that has equal parts of each chemical component, such as 10-10-10 or 20-20-20, or a similar product, for optimum results. Applying fertilizer that contains nitrogen produces greener, lusher plants, and accelerates growth. Fertilize in early spring, before new growth begins.</p> <p><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>4. Pruning:</strong> Thinning the crown increases air circulation, which pushes wind through the tree and helps prevent disease. A good rule of thumb is to prune 2 inches between branches at the top of the tree during early spring, before new growth emerges.</p> <p>Also, trim back any branches dragging the ground. And pinch or clip off nubs that grow from the trunk to maintain the classic Weeping shape. Broken branches, dead branches, or diseased wood can be removed year-round.</p>", "url": "https://www.fast-growing-trees.com/products/weepingwillow?variant=13940758773812&gclid=Cj0KCQjwrrXtBRCKARIsAMbU6bHx_Rq9NL5Di6oiki6OjxT-qQLCi2osrTOdFbeIlsLjfOZnjltDz98aAi8hEALw_wcB", "display_name": "Weeping Willow", "type_name": "product", "id": "fdaeaeced02b8c70106e6d1291d9eeb4", "apple_touch_icon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/d7ef078ae91d94931c0f499a118cf511d8cce83d38508162c422cdeb.png?7cbf8dcce24b7ae67280952669007b1a", "apple_touch_icon_images": {"orig": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/d7ef078ae91d94931c0f499a118cf511d8cce83d38508162c422cdeb.png?7cbf8dcce24b7ae67280952669007b1a"}, "actions": [], "favicon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/741dbd60a816f4b2f97fc7d927577901289074790ea6fd63cabbd77c.png?70a11917ac955e94626c72b63ac898a5"}, "title": "", "board": {"url": "/rjr1031/landscape-plants/", "name": "Landscape Plants"}, "aggregated_pin_data": {}, "image_crop": {"min_y": 0, "max_y": 1}, "pinner": {"image_medium_url": "https://i.pinimg.com/75x75_RS/2c/86/83/2c86833acb59c39d1111f5315a4524b1.jpg", "image_small_url": "https://i.pinimg.com/30x30_RS/2c/86/83/2c86833acb59c39d1111f5315a4524b1.jpg", "id": "185351478322401288", "username": "rjr1031", "follower_count": 24, "verified_identity": {}, "full_name": "Rich Ruffino"}, "link": "https://www.fast-growing-trees.com/products/weepingwillow?variant=13940758773812&gclid=Cj0KCQjwrrXtBRCKARIsAMbU6bHx_Rq9NL5Di6oiki6OjxT-qQLCi2osrTOdFbeIlsLjfOZnjltDz98aAi8hEALw_wcB", "is_downstream_promotion": false}, {"embed": null, "debug_info_html": null, "is_eligible_for_web_closeup": false, "type": "pin", "grid_title": "Brachychiton acerifolius - Flame Tree", "ad_match_reason": 0, "videos": null, "images": {"170x": {"width": 170, "height": 172, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/170x/ad/28/a8/ad28a8b8dcb994761931b04bb8896eac.jpg"}, "236x": {"width": 236, "height": 239, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/236x/ad/28/a8/ad28a8b8dcb994761931b04bb8896eac.jpg"}, "474x": {"width": 474, "height": 481, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/474x/ad/28/a8/ad28a8b8dcb994761931b04bb8896eac.jpg"}, "736x": {"width": 492, "height": 500, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ad/28/a8/ad28a8b8dcb994761931b04bb8896eac.jpg"}, "orig": {"width": 492, "height": 500, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ad/28/a8/ad28a8b8dcb994761931b04bb8896eac.jpg"}}, "has_required_attribution_provider": false, "is_promoted": false, "domain": "smartseedstore.com", "attribution": null, "is_prefetch_enabled": false, "story_pin_data_id": null, "access": [], "id": "862439397379004717", "is_uploaded": false, "carousel_data": null, "dominant_color": "#896a7a", "description": " ", "tracking_params": "CwABAAAAEDMxOTg1NzM2ODE1ODA1ODcGAAMACAA", "created_at": "Wed, 19 Feb 2020 08:55:17 +0000", "promoter": null, "did_its": [], "shopping_flags": [8, 1, 11, 6], "reaction_counts": {}, "buyable_product": null, "image_signature": "ad28a8b8dcb994761931b04bb8896eac", "promoted_is_removable": false, "rich_summary": {"favicon_images": {"orig": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/d6496b396dc8dd2cb80e48952127f8622c85c5fa7089ec8ed74b2675.png?7d8eaef764da05167a5243cc5a55e831", "50x": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/50x/d6496b396dc8dd2cb80e48952127f8622c85c5fa7089ec8ed74b2675.png?7d8eaef764da05167a5243cc5a55e831"}, "type": "richpingriddata", "site_name": "Smart Seeds Emporium", "products": [{"purchase_url": null, "type": "richproductmetadata", "id": "139850829042704", "name": "Brachychiton acerifolius - Flame Tree", "offer_summary": {"price": "$4.29", "in_stock": true, "availability": 1}, "offers": [{"availability": 1, "type": "offermetadata", "price_currency": "USD", "id": "139851455390416", "in_stock": true, "price_value": 4.29, "name": null}]}], "display_description": "Brachychiton acerifolius is one of the world's most beautiful flowering trees.

Planting:</strong>\u00a0Select an area with well-drained soil and full to partial sun\u00a0(4 to 8 hours of sunlight per day). The best time to plant your tree is in the spring after the last frost, or in the fall about six weeks before the first frost.</p> <p>Dig your hole just as deep and twice as wide as the root ball. Leave a small mound of dirt in the center of the hole to set the root ball on and carefully spread the roots in the hole. You\u2019ll want to keep the \u201ccrown\u201d (tip of the root ball) of the tree roughly an inch above the surrounding soil level. Backfill your hole roughly about two-thirds of the way full. Water the tree and fill the rest of the planting hole with soil.\u00a0</p> <p>Finally, spread a 2 to 3-inch layer of mulch over the root area of the tree, keeping it away from the trunk and extending to the tree's drip line.\u00a0</p> <p><strong>2. Watering:</strong>\u00a0Water the tree when the top 2 inches of soil dries (a slow trickle with a garden hose for about 30 minutes is recommended). This could be about twice a week in the summer, or every three weeks in the fall.\u00a0</p> <p><strong>3. Fertilizing:</strong>\u00a0Flowering Cherry Trees do not require fertilizer for the first two years, but when the time comes, fertilize the tree with nitrogen. Apply 1/10 pound of actual nitrogen per year for each year of the tree\u2019s age, with a maximum of 1 pound per year. Apply it once in the spring, or spread the nitrogen amount into\u00a02 to 4 equal applications over the spring and summer.</p> <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> <p><strong>4. Pruning:</strong>\u00a0Removal of the current year\u2019s old, faded flowers and fruit clusters will promote flower buds for the following season. We also recommend pruning your tree during\u00a0dormancy to remove dead or damaged\u00a0branches. Cut small branches less than 3/4 inch in diameter with pruning shears. Use a pruning saw for larger branches. Remove branches just outside the branch collar.</p> <p><strong>BB Tip:</strong>\u00a0Sterilize your pruning tools with a basic household rubbing alcohol for a healthy cut.</p>", "type_name": "product", "apple_touch_icon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/b33d082bd5fde44770fa8b94326c140cc4da6d025720803836f64f39.png?7c20ad685025018238ada6f8d56c2c54", "actions": []}, "image_signature": "1e1a7c30a2141b8f90f9d4270fc1f222", "did_its": [], "carousel_data": null, "type": "pin", "dominant_color": "#b5ab9d", "aggregated_pin_data": {}, "is_uploaded": false, "image_crop": {"min_y": 0, "max_y": 1}, "story_pin_data_id": null, "link": "https://www.brighterblooms.com/products/yoshino-cherry-tree", "has_required_attribution_provider": false, "title": "", "videos": null, "grid_title": "Yoshino Cherry Tree", "id": "617204323919017406", "is_promoted": false, "embed": null, "is_downstream_promotion": false, "is_eligible_for_web_closeup": false, "debug_info_html": null, "attribution": null, "is_prefetch_enabled": false, "promoter": null}, {"promoted_is_removable": false, "shopping_flags": [8, 1, 11, 6], "access": [], "description": " ", "images": {"170x": {"width": 170, "height": 167, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/170x/87/00/a1/8700a190dace64ae5fc886c882f87323.jpg"}, "236x": {"width": 236, "height": 232, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/236x/87/00/a1/8700a190dace64ae5fc886c882f87323.jpg"}, "474x": {"width": 474, "height": 466, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/474x/87/00/a1/8700a190dace64ae5fc886c882f87323.jpg"}, "736x": {"width": 609, "height": 600, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/87/00/a1/8700a190dace64ae5fc886c882f87323.jpg"}, "orig": {"width": 609, "height": 600, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/87/00/a1/8700a190dace64ae5fc886c882f87323.jpg"}}, "buyable_product": null, "tracking_params": "CwABAAAAEDM1NTIwOTY4NzM5NDY0MzIGAAMACAA", "board": {"url": "/carltonhoward04/treesplants/", "name": "Trees/plants"}, "created_at": "Thu, 20 Feb 2020 18:45:21 +0000", "pinner": {"id": "598767850366176961", "image_medium_url": "https://i.pinimg.com/75x75_RS/b8/e2/5c/b8e25c475b274a3421a912344e4b2e21.jpg", "image_small_url": "https://i.pinimg.com/30x30_RS/b8/e2/5c/b8e25c475b274a3421a912344e4b2e21.jpg", "verified_identity": {}, "username": "carltonhoward04", "full_name": "Carlton Andrew", "follower_count": 12}, "reaction_counts": {}, "ad_match_reason": 0, "domain": "plantingtree.com", "rich_summary": {"site_name": "PlantingTree.com", "type": "richpingriddata", "products": [{"id": "140260720530640", "type": "richproductmetadata", "name": "Weeping Willow Tree", "purchase_url": null, "offers": [{"id": "140263517706512", "type": "offermetadata", "name": null, "price_currency": "USD", "in_stock": true, "availability": 1, "price_value": 69.99}], "offer_summary": {"price": "$69.99", "in_stock": true, "availability": 1}}], "display_name": "Weeping Willow Tree", "favicon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/9b09da08972686a6b21a78b7d1f3bed7cab538cf357a99a98edc9a64.png?4bf4d6229ed14efb3e02361b5b536d65", "url": "https://www.plantingtree.com/products/weeping-willow-tree", "id": "ec25c2e0407a23bfd4b1c1bc1957f682", "apple_touch_icon_images": null, "favicon_images": {"orig": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/9b09da08972686a6b21a78b7d1f3bed7cab538cf357a99a98edc9a64.png?4bf4d6229ed14efb3e02361b5b536d65"}, "display_description": "Introduction A True American Classic  Fastest growing weeping tree that brings your shade and comfort to your home.

They are one of the first to produce foliage in the spring and one of the last trees to drop yellow/green leaves in the fall. How To Care When planting your Weeping Willow tree be sure you have the right location and conditions for your new tree to thrive. Spring and Fall are ideal times to plant. However, if you avoid extreme temperatures you can plant your Willow tree almost any time of the year. Weeping Willows thrive in full sun to part shade and are adaptable to almost any\u00a0soil\u00a0as long as it isn't dry. Water deeply 2-3 times weekly for the first 3 months after planting. This helps the tree's roots establish properly. You want to continue to keep the ground moist, especially for the first 2 years. Try using a Treegator and/or adding 2-3 inches of mulch to your young tree to reduce hand watering needs. Examine the leaves regularly to address any signs of over watering or under watering. Falling of leaves can be a sign of under watering. Weeping Willows are great for areas with standing water. Water your mature tree in dry periods. Otherwise, the water requirements are greatly reduced once your tree has been in the ground about 2 years. If your tree needs a boost, fertilize in early spring with a basic slow release fertilizer. Weeping Willows don't generally require pruning, but, if needed, prune when they are dormant in winter or early spring to remove any dead, dying, or crowded branches, or to maintain shape. The Weeping Willow is deer tolerant. The best way to prevent disease and pests is by providing the appropriate care for your plants. Proper location choice, watering, and\u00a0fertilization\u00a0are the keys to your success. Weeping Willows rarely have issues with pests or disease. Occasionally, Scale and Aphids can affect Willows. You can treat these pests naturally with horticultural oil, neem oil, or insecticidal soap. For severe infections you can use pesticides like carbaryl, also known as Sevin. Fungal issues can arise on occasion. Generally, treating after infection isn't extremely effective, so if you have problems yearly treat in early spring with fungicides to prevent infection. Landscape Ideas One of the great characteristics of a Willow Tree is its ability to soak up excess water. Have a problem area in your landscape where standing water is being a nuisance? The Weeping Willow will absorb all that extra water and provide shade in the process. These trees are great to plant beside ponds and lakes because of their love for excess water. Even though these trees are normally found near bodies of water, they will thrive in almost any condition and display some tolerance to drought.Weeping Willow trees are very adaptable to different types of soils and growing conditions and can even help minimize soil erosion. The Weeping Willow tree is sure to enchant your landscape with its beautiful and sweeping branches. The\u00a0River Birch tree\u00a0is also a great alternativeFor additional options, be sure to browse our\u00a0Willow Tree\u00a0and\u00a0Shade Tree\u00a0collections", "type_name": "product",

Hardiness Zones are 6-8, doing best by water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds, but will do fine in well-watered yards. The best soil for these beautiful trees are acidic, alkaline, loamy, moist, rich, sandy, and clay soils. In sunlight and partial shade, they can grow 24 inches per year, making Weeping Willows fast and easy to grow trees. Early spring these monster sized trees yellow branches will have green foliage that will weep, making Weeping Willow the perfect name for a rare plant. Buy Weeping willow tree\u00a0From A Trusted Nursery Tennessee Wholesale \u00a0Majestic in appearance, it stems from China but has spread throughout the world in recent centuries. These trees mistakenly identified with the trees mentioned about Babylon in the Psalms. These enormous trees are associated with the feeling of melancholy because the branches give the appearance that the tree is weeping. This impression amplified by the fact that these trees frequently are found at the banks of rivers, ponds, and other bodies of water. In the United States, that range includes middle America and most of the south, northeast, and northwest. While placement near water is ideal, willows can also plant in drier conditions. Affordable Weeping Willow Tree\u00a0For Every Landscape Weeping willows proliferate, sometimes increasing in size at as much as two feet a year. In addition to their positive ornamental qualities, willows provide excellent shelter for a variety of birds and small mammals and are favorite nesting spots.

Hence, they make excellent book nooks and picnic spots. Moreover, they add a touch of elegance to any landscape, whether on their own or as part of a grove of trees.

Shipping Dates Ships November through April Description Black Oak Tree - Quercus velutina\u00a0\u00a0For Sale Affordable, Grower Direct Prices Tennessee Wholesale Nursery Black Oak Tree deriving its name from the dark, deeply grooved nearly black bark of older trees, younger Black Oak trees may appear gray in color. They are distinguishable from its relative the red oak by deep green leaves with seven to nine pointed lobes rather than the rounded lobes of the red oak. A medium to large tree, the black oak can attain heights of 80 feet, although soil conditions will affect the tree's development. In the wild, it begins to produce acorns at about 20 years with a life span of 100 to 500 years. The Black Oak is found throughout the eastern United States north of Florida. Its exceptionally deep tap root gives it the ability to withstand drought and poor soil better than some other varieties, but it does not tolerate shade well and is difficult to transplant. Its primary use is as a shade tree grown in place. Fall foliage ranges from dull red to orange-brown, and the Black Oak can tolerate cold winters down to USDA Zone 3. Buy Fast Growing Black Oaks\u00a0 This tree grows best in moist soils. The Black Oak starts creating acorns at age two. This tree can be three feet per year. This tree is fantastic and produces large leaves that help provide lots of shade during the spring and summer. They can grow to become seventy to eighty feet tall when fully mature and look amazing. During the autumn the foliage changes to a golden in color and provide lots of bright colors. They grow best because they can adapt well to all different types of soil conditions. They bloom during the spring and early part of summer. They produce huge canopies, so they need lots of room to grow and mature into healthy and beautiful trees.

It grows at the pace of 2 to 3 feet a year, and can reach 30 feet in 15 years. <br> <br> <strong>Its spreading habit creates a wide canopy of cooling shade.</strong> This fast-growing tree starts out with a pyramidal shape, but it matures to a broad, rounded canopy with dense leaves for effortless shade. New leaves emerge a bright yellow-green, darken to lustrous mid green in summer, and then turn rich gold and russet in the fall. They have distinctive toothed edges, inspiring the tree's common name.<br> <br><b>Why Fast-Growing-Trees.com is Better</b></p> <p>First, this tough tree is untroubled by diseases, drought or pollution.<strong> </strong>Strong and adaptable, it makes a stately, carefree shade tree in your yard, lining a long drive or along a street. </p> <p>But the best part is the fact that we've planted, grown and nurtured our Sawtooth Oaks for amazing results in your own landscape. Now, you reap the rewards of strong, healthy good looks...we've done the hard work at our nursery so that you get a head start.</p> <p>Don't wait - <strong>get your own Sawtooth Oak Tree today!</strong></p> <!-- split --> <h2>Planting & Care</h2> <p><strong>1. Planting:</strong> Your planting site should be made of loose, quality soil with plenty of sun. When you're ready to plant, dig your hole two times the width and the same depth as the root system of the tree. Position the tree into the hole and hold it straight as you begin to back fill. When refilling the hole with soil, be sure to completely cover your roots and tamp down the soil so there are no air pockets underground.</p> <p>Cover the roots completely with soil but leave the stem above ground. Water the oak's planting site to settle the soil and then mulch to retain moisture.</p> <p><strong>2. Watering:</strong> During the first year, make sure your Sawtooth Oak Tree gets water during extended dry spells, particularly in the summer months. If you're not sure when to water, simply check the surrounding soil at a depth of 3 inches - if the soil is dry here, water your Sawtooth.</p> <p><strong>3. Fertilizing:</strong> Fertilize conservatively. Organic fertilizer high in nitrogen works well. You can use a 10-10-10 or 20-20-20 fertilizer and follow label instructions.</p>", "type_name": "product", "apple_touch_icon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/d7ef078ae91d94931c0f499a118cf511d8cce83d38508162c422cdeb.png?7cbf8dcce24b7ae67280952669007b1a", "actions": []}, "image_signature": "6291f4abad38ca0139e2ef1e86f95296", "did_its": [], "carousel_data": null, "type": "pin", "dominant_color": "#8ba786", "aggregated_pin_data": {}, "is_uploaded": false, "image_crop": {"min_y": 0, "max_y": 1}, "story_pin_data_id": null, "link": "https://www.fast-growing-trees.com/products/sawtoothoak", "has_required_attribution_provider": false, "title": "", "videos": null, "grid_title": "Sawtooth Oak Tree", "id": "772437773576437319", "is_promoted": false, "embed": null, "is_downstream_promotion": false, "is_eligible_for_web_closeup": false, "debug_info_html": null, "attribution": null, "is_prefetch_enabled": false, "promoter": null}, {"promoted_is_removable": false, "shopping_flags": [8, 1, 11, 6], "access": [], "description": " ", "images": {"170x": {"width": 170, "height": 226, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/170x/1d/94/ba/1d94ba5a6aa482ceac89db3af1bb38c3.jpg"}, "236x": {"width": 236, "height": 314, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/236x/1d/94/ba/1d94ba5a6aa482ceac89db3af1bb38c3.jpg"}, "474x": {"width": 300, "height": 400, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/474x/1d/94/ba/1d94ba5a6aa482ceac89db3af1bb38c3.jpg"}, "736x": {"width": 300, "height": 400, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1d/94/ba/1d94ba5a6aa482ceac89db3af1bb38c3.jpg"}, "orig": {"width": 300, "height": 400, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1d/94/ba/1d94ba5a6aa482ceac89db3af1bb38c3.jpg"}}, "buyable_product": null, "tracking_params": "CwABAAAAEDM1NTIwOTY4NzM5NDY0MzIGAAMACAA", "board": {"url": "/indivisibleby3/art-thoughts/", "name": "art thoughts"}, "created_at": "Fri, 21 Feb 2020 23:38:52 +0000", "pinner": {"id": "329325928909906342", "image_medium_url": "https://s.pinimg.com/images/user/default_75.png", "image_small_url": "https://s.pinimg.com/images/user/default_30.png", "verified_identity": {}, "username": "indivisibleby3", "full_name": "i b", "follower_count": 33}, "reaction_counts": {}, "ad_match_reason": 0, "domain": "ebay.com", "rich_summary": {"site_name": "eBay", "type": "richpingriddata", "products": [{"id": "140260669642320", "type": "richproductmetadata", "name": "Details about Norway Spruce, Picea abies, Tree Seeds (Fast Evergreen)", "purchase_url": null, "offers": [{"id": "140260672427856", "type": "offermetadata", "name": null, "price_currency": "USD", "in_stock": true, "availability": 1, "price_value": 2}], "offer_summary": {"price": "$2", "in_stock": true, "availability": 1}}], "display_name": "Details about Norway Spruce, Picea abies, Tree Seeds (Fast Evergreen)", "favicon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/75a23c2b2317fabd4d3a561b2998b2123904230e6fe500becbcced45.ico?bfa98992756df2a8ed678ef30c223ac3", "url": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Norway-Spruce-Picea-abies-Tree-Seeds-Fast-Evergreen-/281242050265?oid=271797406621", "id": "d55f37cadbd00dbf61b3d8e7dd24c695", "apple_touch_icon_images": {"orig": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/ff69f9b1d4999d5469acd2b6286cf431a406efd0f8b0e9d5e0e5e121.png?6ece3acceb4a37da96a8f2d2f0fd9ba1"}, "favicon_images": {"orig": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/75a23c2b2317fabd4d3a561b2998b2123904230e6fe500becbcced45.ico?bfa98992756df2a8ed678ef30c223ac3"}, "display_description": "", "type_name": "product", "apple_touch_icon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/ff69f9b1d4999d5469acd2b6286cf431a406efd0f8b0e9d5e0e5e121.png?6ece3acceb4a37da96a8f2d2f0fd9ba1", "actions": []}, "image_signature": "1d94ba5a6aa482ceac89db3af1bb38c3", "did_its": [], "carousel_data": null, "type": "pin", "dominant_color": "#7d9b6b", "aggregated_pin_data": {}, "is_uploaded": false, "image_crop": {"min_y": 0, "max_y": 1}, "story_pin_data_id": null, "link": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Norway-Spruce-Picea-abies-Tree-Seeds-Fast-Evergreen-/281242050265?oid=271797406621", "has_required_attribution_provider": false, "title": "", "videos": null, "grid_title": "Norway Spruce, Picea abies, Tree Seeds (Fast Evergreen)  | eBay", "id": "329325791504395631", "is_promoted": false, "embed": null, "is_downstream_promotion": false, "is_eligible_for_web_closeup": false, "debug_info_html": null, "attribution": null, "is_prefetch_enabled": false, "promoter": null}, {"promoted_is_removable": false, "shopping_flags": [], "access": [], "description": "Jungle Gardens located on Avery Island, 50 min from Lafayette or 2.5 hrs from New Orleans Discover\u00a0 beautiful places on earth.

It is a fast-growing tree that is a great choice for wetter conditions and clay soils, but it will grow well in regular soil too. It will resist the poor air of urban conditions and do well on compacted soil as well. Pin Oak makes a broad shade-tree that has a rounded crown and turns attractive shades of reddish-bronze in fall, a lovely contrast to the colors of other trees at that season. It will grow up to 3 feet a year and should be at least 15 feet tall in just 5 years, making it the fastest-growing oak available. It will grow from zone 4 to zone 8 so it can be grown almost anywhere.  \tGreat shade-tree for wet and heavy soils  \tUnusual bronzy fall coloring  \tVery fast growing  \tResistant to urban conditions  \tEasy to grow and trouble-free If you want a long-lived but fast growing shade tree for a large yard, the Pin Oak is a terrific choice, especially if your soil is often wet.

How To Care When planting your Yoshino Cherry tree be sure you have the right location and conditions for your new tree to thrive. Spring and fall are ideal times to plant. However, if you avoid freezing temperatures and extreme heat you can plant your Flowering Cherry tree almost any time of the year. Yoshino Flowering Cherry trees thrive in full sun and are extremely adaptable to any soil as long as it is well drained. Water deeply when planting and twice weekly for about 3 months while your new tree is establishing. Once your tree is established you will only need to water during dry periods. When the soil is dry(and especially in high temperatures) water deeply once or twice weekly as needed to keep the soil moist. Adding a layer of mulch is recommended especially with newly planted trees. This will help keep the soil moist and cool in summer and protect the roots in winter as well. Do not allow the mulch to touch the trunk as this increases the chances of pests and disease. Fertilize in early spring and when planting to give your tree a boost. Choose a\u00a0balanced, slow release fertilizer. Pruning is not recommended for ornamental Cherry trees, but, if needed, prune in winter or early spring to remove any dead, dying, or crowded branches. The best way to prevent disease and pests is by providing the appropriate care for your plants. Proper location choice, watering, and fertilization are the keys to your success. Scale, Aphids and Mites are insects that can affect Flowering Cherry trees. You can treat these pests naturally with horticultural oil, neem oil, or insecticidal soap. For severe infections you can use pesticides like carbaryl, also known as Sevin. Tent Caterpillars and Cankerworms are sometimes an issue for Flowering Cherry Trees. These can be treated with an organic pesticide spray, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Occasionally fungal issues can arise. Generally, treating after infection isn't extremely effective, so if you have problems yearly treat in early spring with fungicides to prevent infection. Neem Oil is an organic method of treating and preventing some fungal diseases and pests. It can be effective, but the entire tree must be coated in order for this method to be effective.

Dogwoods are sensitive and when dug out of the ground (bare-root) they are susceptible to disease and death. Shipping you a Dogwood Tree in a container, ensures you will have a healthy tree that will explode with growth the first year.</p><!-- split --><h2>Planting & Care</h2><p>The Red Dogwood (<em>Cornus Florida</em>) is the perfect tree for smaller yards moderately growing to a mature height and width of 20-25 feet. Since it\u2019s good for USDA growing zones 5-9, it has the ability to grow in just about any climate providing it gets the proper full to partial sun exposure required. It grows into a pyramidal shape with oval, bright green leaves that give way to beautiful fall colors of a rich red-brown. Birds love the small, bright red fruits that mature in late summer to early fall and have the ability to last until late in the year. During the blooming season, look for the dainty, red or pink flowers that are described as hermaphroditic, meaning \u201cperfect flowers.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Seasonal Information:</strong> With proper time & care, Dogwood trees can be planted at any time of the year. If your area is experiencing extreme heat, place your potted tree in a well shaded area, such as a garage, or plant it in a well shaded area of your lawn. Once mature, your tree will be better able to manage with temperatures of this kind. Typically, though, trees do not experience much growth during times of extreme temperature.</p> <p><strong>Location:</strong> Choose a planting site for your Dogwood that receives light or filtered shade. Dogwood trees are highly adaptable to many soil types. However, they thrive best in moist, fertile soils high in organic matter. The soil of your planting site should be well drained, with a 5.5 pH level.</p> <p><strong>Planting Instructions:</strong><strong><br></strong>1) Dig a planting hole for your dogwood that is two times the diameter of your tree\u2019s root ball and comprised of equal depth.<br>2) Remove your Dogwood from its container and ensure root moisture.<br>3) Place your tree in the planting hole, keeping the top of the root ball even with the ground.<br>4) Adjust your tree\u2019s position and angle, then use the original soil to fill the planting hole.<br>5) Spread the roots out evenly and surround them with soil, tamping down lightly as you fill to avoid air pockets, which can dry out the roots of your tree.<br>6) Avoid firming the soil at this point, and instead water the area immediately to settle the soil.<br>7) Mulch around the base of the tree to conserve soil moisture. This will also keep competing growth (grass and weeds) from growing around the planting site.</p> <p><strong>Watering:</strong> Dogwood trees possess very shallow root systems that are susceptible to drying out in the absence of regular rainfall. It is best to water your tree once or twice a week. Be sure to water correctly. Light green leaves are a sign of overwatering, while drooping leaves signify both over watering and under watering. Watch for these and any other signs that your tree is getting too much or too little water.</p> <p><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Dogwood trees do not require much fertilization. If you choose to fertilize your tree, do so sparingly in April or May. Any general purpose fertilizer is suitable for this.</p> <p><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Do not permit weeds or grasses any closer than 2-3 feet from your Dogwood in the first year. Pull the weeds initially, and then utilize a growing mat or mulch. Insulate the roots 2-4 inches and replenish as needed. Do not spray Round Up on a young Dogwood, and ensure that wind doesn\u2019t blow chemical drift onto your tree.</p> <p><strong>Pests & Disease:</strong> The best defense against any pest or disease issue is a healthy tree. Good soil, proper feeding & healthy watering habits are vital to the prosperity of your tree.</p> <p><strong>Deer:</strong> If you believe that deer may become an issue for your Dogwood, consider caging the tree(s). Although there is a whole host of deer deterrents available, nothing will guarantee protection like caging will.</p> <p><strong>Winter Dormancy:</strong> During late fall and winter, your Dogwood will enter its dormant state. When this occurs, your tree\u2019s leaves will fall off and the stem will turn brown. Above ground, nothing will take place during this time, but the roots of your tree will continue to grow beneath the surface. This winter root development will accelerate the growth of your tree come spring.</p>", "type_name": "product", "display_name": "Red Dogwood", "apple_touch_icon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/d7ef078ae91d94931c0f499a118cf511d8cce83d38508162c422cdeb.png?7cbf8dcce24b7ae67280952669007b1a"}, "promoted_is_removable": false, "description": "Red Flowering Dogwood Trees for Sale | Fast Growing Trees \u2013 Fast-Growing-Trees.com", "image_crop": {"min_y": 0, "max_y": 1}, "image_signature": "fd55eda08ab237260d582328c740089c", "is_prefetch_enabled": false, "board": {"url": "/naculver/garden/", "name": "GARDEN"}, "reaction_counts": {}, "shopping_flags": [8, 1, 11, 6], "is_uploaded": false, "buyable_product": null, "attribution": null, "ad_match_reason": 0, "images": {"170x": {"width": 170, "height": 210, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/170x/fd/55/ed/fd55eda08ab237260d582328c740089c.jpg"}, "236x": {"width": 236, "height": 292, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/236x/fd/55/ed/fd55eda08ab237260d582328c740089c.jpg"}, "474x": {"width": 450, "height": 558, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/474x/fd/55/ed/fd55eda08ab237260d582328c740089c.jpg"}, "736x": {"width": 450, "height": 558, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/fd/55/ed/fd55eda08ab237260d582328c740089c.jpg"}, "orig": {"width": 450, "height": 558, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fd/55/ed/fd55eda08ab237260d582328c740089c.jpg"}}, "domain": "fast-growing-trees.com", "is_promoted": false, "type": "pin", "promoter": null, "did_its": [], "created_at": "Mon, 17 Feb 2020 20:27:38 +0000", "id": "1829656087706872", "tracking_params": "CwABAAAAEDU0MzM2MjMxMjc5OTE5NDEGAAMACAA", "aggregated_pin_data": {}, "link": "https://www.fast-growing-trees.com/products/redfloweringdogwood", "embed": null, "grid_title": "Red Dogwood", "pinner": {"username": "naculver", "follower_count": 271, "image_small_url": "https://i.pinimg.com/30x30_RS/1b/0c/de/1b0cdedabe0b7735b41520972abb8df9.jpg", "full_name": "Annette Culver", "image_medium_url": "https://i.pinimg.com/75x75_RS/1b/0c/de/1b0cdedabe0b7735b41520972abb8df9.jpg", "id": "1829793507054616", "verified_identity": {}}, "carousel_data": null, "is_downstream_promotion": false, "videos": null}, {"debug_info_html": null, "access": [], "is_eligible_for_web_closeup": false, "title": "", "has_required_attribution_provider": false, "dominant_color": "#555229", "story_pin_data_id": null, "rich_summary": {"favicon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/2f4eae87cdef9266487ebf7510c81919d58d650c4390ca6e376ba097.ico?c354b991760f92804d3e7a55bc53b794", "type": "richpingriddata", "site_name": "Pixers", "products": [{"purchase_url": null, "offers": [{"price_currency": "USD", "type": "offermetadata", "price_value": 59, "name": null, "in_stock": true, "availability": 1, "id": "139760450324112"}], "type": "richproductmetadata", "name": "Live Oak tree forest Wall Mural \u2022 Pixers\u00ae -

Named because they grow upward in a tight column, this ginkgo will grow about 6-8 ft. wide and around 20 ft. tall. If you've never seen a ginkgo leaf, they are one of the most beautiful leaves of any tree. They will add an exotic appeal to any garden or yard. Ginkgo trees grow a uniform light green in the spring and darken up slightly in the summer. In the fall ginkgo trees have consistent golden leaves. The color is outstanding and can rival any other tree for fall beauty. Combine these with red maples, dogwoods, or a purple leave cherry for an amazing display.All 'Sky Tower' Ginkgo Trees are of a male selection - meaning they will not produce fruit. These trees are very hardy and have withstood the test of time. The ginkgo is literally 270 million years old, making it one of the most ancient and successful trees. When caring for these trees we recommend maintaining the usual mulch ring to protect the tree from elements, competing plants, and yard equipment for the first few years. Slow release fertilizer can be applied (per directions on the bag) in the early fall to give the tree a boost that will carry through to spring.

Bought the 5-6 foot version and it was \"bent\" in half when it arrived, so I was a bit concerned. It had some leaves on it. Planted it on my property with a stake to straighten it. Several months later, the tree is flourishing! It's grown significantly (I tied a bow on the tree where it met the top of the stake so I could see if it grew taller). It's grown taller, lots of new branches, and full of leaves. I absolutely love it and can't wait to watch it get bigger and bigger! Helpful Gardening Tips Click here to view our blog.

As a sapling, the tree starts as a thin trunk with few branches. As it grows, the branches grow up and then curve downward, which forms the canopy. It is supported by a stout trunk. This deciduous tree grows great by water and is even able to absorb standing water. Although they grow exceptionally well by lakes and rivers, they can adapt to other soil types, including sandy, moist, acidic, clay, and many others. The weeping willow is a thriving water tree, and it's branched drapes to the ground when mature. This tree is a very fast growing one, and it's also majestic enough to plant in upscale landscape designs. Buy Fast Growing Weeping Willow Tree Yellow to silver-green blooms appears in April and May. The leaves are 6-8 inches long, light green, and narrow. Leaves are also long-lasting, often being one of the first to produce leaves in the spring and last to lose its leaves in the fall. During the fall, leaves turn yellow before falling to the ground. 1/4 inch brown fruit grows on the leaves, but produce little to no litter. The tree usually lives for about 30 years.

Environmentalists sometimes plant this tree in clusters beside brooks, so their vigorous roots systems will help prevent soil erosion. Some 400 different species of willows exist today, ranging in size from shrubs to towering trees with arching, overhanging branches.\u00a0 \u00a0 A Historically Important Plant \u00a0 \u00a0People have cultivated willow trees for thousands of years. The plant's bark contains ingredients which ultimately contributed to the development of aspirin, a necessary over-the-counter pain relief medication. Some butterfly species rely on the willow as an essential food source. Additionally, many cultivars of the Weeping Willow Tree provide vital seasonal nutrition for honey bee colonies during early Spring. (In parts of North America, some willows begin developing leaves as early as February.) \u00a0 The Weeping Willow Tree: Visually Stunning \u00a0 \u00a0The Weeping Willow Tree possesses a characteristic appearance. It creates an umbrella-like canopy, its limbs covered with hanging leafy branches that arch outwards distinctively from the trunk. Leaves develop laterally along every branch; no terminal buds form. The light green foliage assumes an attractive yellowish-gold color during autumn.\u00a0 \u00a0 Growing Conditions \u00a0 \u00a0These rapidly growing trees survive from Zone 3 through Zone 10. They range in height from 50 to 82 feet.

Great for soaking up standing water or wet areas Provides excellent shade over your patio or yard  Never Bareroot... All plants come rooted into a container with soil. Description The Weeping Willow Tree is a graceful and refined shade tree with long, ground-sweeping branches. This beautiful shade tree will grow to astounding heights and will do so at a very accelerated rate. Reaching heights of 30\u2019 to 40\u2019 and a mature width of 35\u2019 this tree will provide a cool shady oasis for hot summer days. Willow trees have pretty green foliage that can be characterized as long and thin shaped leaves. They are one of the first to produce foliage in the spring and one of the last trees to drop yellow/green leaves in the fall. How To Care When planting your Weeping Willow tree be sure you have the right location and conditions for your new tree to thrive. Spring and Fall are ideal times to plant. However, if you avoid extreme temperatures you can plant your Willow tree almost any time of the year. Weeping Willows thrive in full sun to part shade and are adaptable to almost any\u00a0soil\u00a0as long as it isn't dry. Water deeply 2-3 times weekly for the first 3 months after planting. This helps the tree's roots establish properly. You want to continue to keep the ground moist, especially for the first 2 years. Try using a Treegator and/or adding 2-3 inches of mulch to your young tree to reduce hand watering needs. Examine the leaves regularly to address any signs of over watering or under watering. Falling of leaves can be a sign of under watering. Weeping Willows are great for areas with standing water. Water your mature tree in dry periods. Otherwise, the water requirements are greatly reduced once your tree has been in the ground about 2 years. If your tree needs a boost, fertilize in early spring with a basic slow release fertilizer. Weeping Willows don't generally require pruning, but, if needed, prune when they are dormant in winter or early spring to remove any dead, dying, or crowded branches, or to maintain shape. The Weeping Willow is deer tolerant. The best way to prevent disease and pests is by providing the appropriate care for your plants. Proper location choice, watering, and\u00a0fertilization\u00a0are the keys to your success. Weeping Willows rarely have issues with pests or disease. Occasionally, Scale and Aphids can affect Willows. You can treat these pests naturally with horticultural oil, neem oil, or insecticidal soap. For severe infections you can use pesticides like carbaryl, also known as Sevin. Fungal issues can arise on occasion. Generally, treating after infection isn't extremely effective, so if you have problems yearly treat in early spring with fungicides to prevent infection. Landscape Ideas One of the great characteristics of a Willow Tree is its ability to soak up excess water. Have a problem area in your landscape where standing water is being a nuisance? The Weeping Willow will absorb all that extra water and provide shade in the process. These trees are great to plant beside ponds and lakes because of their love for excess water.

Planting:</strong> Plant your Weeping Willow in full sun to partial shade (any area with about 4 to 8 hours of sunlight per day), select a site with well-drained soil, and space at least 35 feet from your septic system or leach field. When you're ready to plant, dig a hole three times the width and just as deep as the root ball on your tree. Place your tree in the hole, straighten it, gently back fill the soil and tamp it down. After this process is complete, give your tree a long drink of water until the soil becomes moist.</p> <p>Spreading a layer of mulch that\u2019s about three inches thick around the base of your tree will help the soil retain moisture and prevent weeds from growing.</p> <p><strong>2. Watering:</strong> You should regularly water your Weeping Willow for the first year to keep soil evenly moist (about once or twice weekly). Water your Willow only during dry periods in successive years. Although Weeping Willows prefer moist soil, they adapt easily to drier soil.</p> <p><strong>3. Fertilizing:</strong> Choose a brand that has equal parts of each chemical component, such as 10-10-10 or 20-20-20, or a similar product, for optimum results. Applying fertilizer that contains nitrogen produces greener, lusher plants, and accelerates growth. Fertilize in early spring, before new growth begins.</p> <p><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>4. Pruning:</strong> Thinning the crown increases air circulation, which pushes wind through the tree and helps prevent disease. A good rule of thumb is to prune 2 inches between branches at the top of the tree during early spring, before new growth emerges.</p> <p>Also, trim back any branches dragging the ground. And pinch or clip off nubs that grow from the trunk to maintain the classic Weeping shape. Broken branches, dead branches, or diseased wood can be removed year-round.</p>", "type_name": "product", "display_name": "Weeping Willow", "apple_touch_icon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/d7ef078ae91d94931c0f499a118cf511d8cce83d38508162c422cdeb.png?7cbf8dcce24b7ae67280952669007b1a"}, "promoted_is_removable": false, "description": "Weeping Willow Shade Trees for Sale \u2013 FastGrowingTrees.com", "image_crop": {"min_y": 0, "max_y": 1}, "image_signature": "2779d8e18180e1c4e40d0859e53fce24", "is_prefetch_enabled": false, "board": {"url": "/florica_omut/gardening/", "name": "Gardening"}, "reaction_counts": {}, "shopping_flags": [8, 1, 11, 6], "is_uploaded": false, "buyable_product": null, "attribution": null, "ad_match_reason": 0, "images": {"170x": {"width": 170, "height": 170, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/170x/27/79/d8/2779d8e18180e1c4e40d0859e53fce24.jpg"}, "236x": {"width": 236, "height": 236, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/236x/27/79/d8/2779d8e18180e1c4e40d0859e53fce24.jpg"}, "474x": {"width": 350, "height": 350, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/474x/27/79/d8/2779d8e18180e1c4e40d0859e53fce24.jpg"}, "736x": {"width": 350, "height": 350, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/27/79/d8/2779d8e18180e1c4e40d0859e53fce24.jpg"}, "orig": {"width": 350, "height": 350, "url": "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/27/79/d8/2779d8e18180e1c4e40d0859e53fce24.jpg"}}, "domain": "fast-growing-trees.com", "is_promoted": false, "type": "pin", "promoter": null, "did_its": [], "created_at": "Sun, 17 Nov 2019 12:55:14 +0000", "id": "366480488430614083", "tracking_params": "CwABAAAAEDU0MzM2MjMxMjc5OTE5NDEGAAMACAA", "aggregated_pin_data": {}, "link": "https://www.fast-growing-trees.com/products/weepingwillow?variant=13940758642740&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=roi+dynamic+remarketing+2017&utm_content=viewed+or+added+to+cart+30+november&utm_term=newvalueprop+badge+allproducts&sfns=mo", "embed": null, "grid_title": "Weeping Willow", "pinner": {"username": "florica_omut", "follower_count": 1322, "image_small_url": "https://i.pinimg.com/30x30_RS/a4/f2/95/a4f295ebb2fdf600bc7088aa70252baa.jpg", "full_name": "Florica Omut", "image_medium_url": "https://i.pinimg.com/75x75_RS/a4/f2/95/a4f295ebb2fdf600bc7088aa70252baa.jpg", "id": "366480625835816922", "verified_identity": {}}, "carousel_data": null, "is_downstream_promotion": false, "videos": null}, {"debug_info_html": null, "access": [], "is_eligible_for_web_closeup": false, "title": "", "has_required_attribution_provider": false, "dominant_color": "#1a2327", "story_pin_data_id": null, "rich_summary": {"favicon_link": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/bd7959029018996519ad3c78390d22e387fdc5500bc5dbfc88a22983.png?7e85e31127ed7561ddde01a9c6382799", "type": "richpingriddata", "site_name": "The Tree Center", "products": [{"purchase_url": null, "offers": [{"price_currency": "USD", "type": "offermetadata", "price_value": 59.5, "name": null, "in_stock": true, "availability": 1, "id": "139760236281808"}], "type": "richproductmetadata", "name": "Ann Magnolia", "id": "139760854986384", "offer_summary": {"price": "$59.50", "in_stock": true, "availability": 1}}], "actions": [], "id": "85db59d9ca1b9247b8719fa0f194021a", "url": "https://www.thetreecenter.com/ann-magnolia/", "apple_touch_icon_images": null, "favicon_images": {"orig": "https://i.pinimg.com/favicons/bd7959029018996519ad3c78390d22e387fdc5500bc5dbfc88a22983.png?7e85e31127ed7561ddde01a9c6382799"}, "display_description": "The Ann Magnolia is a wonderful spring-flowering tree guaranteed to turn heads and win hearts.

This variety is one of the \u2018Girl Series\u2019, a special group of trees developed right here in the USA to resist the late frosts that make so many other varieties of magnolia trees hard to grow in colder areas. This tree will grow only to around 10 feet tall, with a low crown almost the same width. It has attractive oval leaves about 6 inches long, which turn yellow in fall. Grow it as a lawn specimen, among other large shrubs, or beneath deciduous trees.  \tLarge upright blossoms of a rich purple-pink  \tSpring-blooming small tree with amazing blooms  \tBlooms later, so protected from spring frost  \tHardy even to minus 30  \tGrows well in sun or shade A sunny or partially-shaded site is best for your Ann Magnolia. Grow it in soil that has been enriched with organic material, and add organic mulch over the root-zone each year. Water once or twice a week during the first season, and after that do not let it become completely dry. A mature tree will have moderate drought-resistance. This tree has no significant pests and diseases, and needs no pruning to become a treasure in your garden. This variety is ideal for northern gardeners, since it is hardy to zone 4, and blooms later, so avoiding late spring-frosts.", "type_name": "product", "display_name": "Ann Magnolia",
